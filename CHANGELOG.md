# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.77.3] - 2021-03-01
### Changed
- Reinstated the worker pool for `.md` / `.mdx` compilation. This attempts to spread the the work of transpiling mdx across multiple workers.

### Fixed
- Fixed invocation of server functions that do not return `Promise` instances by calling them in the handler of a resolved promise.

## [0.77.2] - 2021-02-27
### Fixed
- Revert chunk paths in nostalgie build while a bug in their resolution is investigated.

## [0.77.1] - 2021-02-27
### Changed
- Moved MDX building into the main CLI process (for now) in an attempt to simplify some of the diagnostics via esbuild.

## [0.77.0] - 2021-02-26
### Changed
- **BREAKING** Renamed the `nostalgie/helmet` runtime module to `nostalgie/markup` to better reflect its purpose: affecting the generated markup. The `Helmet`, `HelmetProps` and `HelmetTags` have been renamed to `Markup`, `MarkupProps` and `MarkupTags`, respectively.
  
  As a reminder, the `nostalgie/markup` module is your one-stop shop to set the page title, meta tags or other markup-related features:
  
  ```tsx
  import { Markup } from "nostalgie/markup";
  
  export function MyPage() {
    return (
      <>
        <Markup>
          <title>My page title</title>
        </Markup>
        <h1>My page</h1>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

## [0.76.0] - 2021-02-23
### Added
- Improved typing and behaviour of the `styled` helper function.
- Changed the `CodeSnippets` component to hide line numbers by default but to show them with an MDX annotation of `lines` or an boolean prop `lineNumbers`.
  
  Also made various improvements to overflow and highlighting of lines in the `CodeSnippets` component.
  
  For example, the following:
  
  ````md
  ```js
  console.log('hello world');
  ```
  ````
  
  Results in:
  
  ```js
  console.log('hello world');
  ```
  
  And the following:
  
  ````md
  ```js lines
  console.log('hello world');
  ```
  ````
  
  Results in:
  
  ```js lines
  console.log('hello world');
  ```

## [0.75.1] - 2021-02-19
### Fixed
- Fixes a bug in the server renderer wherein a superfluous comma could get inserted in the initial server markup.

## [0.75.0] - 2021-02-19
### Added
- Adds the `code:<import_specifier>` import syntax to import an instance of the `<CodeSnippet />` component, wired up with the source code of the file to which the `<import_specifier>` resolves.
  
  This is expected to be useful in documentation and tutorials so that such documents can refer directly to concrete examples instead of having to duplicate the code.
  
  Example:
  
  ```mdx
  import Changelog from 'code:./CHANGELOG.md';
  
  Here are the first 6 lines of our changelog, with the emphasis put on the 5th and 6th lines.
  
  <Changelog toLine={6} emphasizeLines={[[5,6]]} />
  ```

### Changed
- Fixed support for the `styled` function and custom components.
  
  You can now do the following:
  
  ```js
  import { styled } from 'nostalgie/styling';
  
  function MyComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
  
  // Template string api
  export const MyComponentRed = styled(MyComponent)`
    color: red;
  `;
  
  // Object style api
  export const MyComponentBlue = styled(MyComponent){
    color: 'blue',
  };
  ```
- Refactored how code blocks are rendered in `.md` and `.mdx` to use a new, internal `<CodeSnippet />` component. This new component supports emphasizing certain lines. Instead of each code snippet having static react components created at build time, this approach compiles a json representation of the snippet and styling information that a shared `<CodeSnippet />` component consumes at runtime.
  
  Code blocks now support chosing different themes for each code block. Themes can either be chosen from one of the themes built into [shiki](npm.im/shiki) ([see here](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/master/docs/themes.md) for a list of built-in themes). For example:
  
  ````md
  ```ts theme:nord
  function helloWorkd() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
  ```
  ````
  
  Produces:
  
  ```ts theme:nord
  function helloWorkd() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
  ```
  
  This feature also supports loading themes from relative (to the `.md` or `.mdx` file) or absolute paths. For example:
  
  ````md
  ```ts theme:./themes/OneDark.json
  function helloWorkd() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
  ```
  ````
  
  Produces:
  
  ```ts theme:./themes/OneDark.json
  function helloWorkd() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
  ```
  
  Additionally, ranges of lines can be emphasized by using the `emphasize` meta option on code blocks. Multiple instances of the `emphasize` option can be used to highlight several ranges. For example:
  
  ````md
  ```ts emphasize:2-4
  function helloWorld() {
    // For some reason,
    // we decided to emphasize this comment
    // and split it across 3 lines!?
  }
  ```
  ````
  
  Produces:
  
  ```ts emphasize:2-4
  function helloWorld() {
    // For some reason,
    // we decided to emphasize this comment
    // and split it across 3 lines!?
  }
  ```

## [0.74.0] - 2021-02-13
### Added
- Added ability to gracefully recover from and log build errors in `dev` mode.
- Add support for handling server-side redirects triggered by `nostalgie/router`'s `<Redirect />` component (via `react-router`).
  
  Whereas before an app without redirects would be fully functional with JavaScript disabled, one with redirects would sit idle on any route intending to trigger a redirect. This change will result in a `302` response with a `Location` header and some (very) simple markup explaining the iminent redirect.
- Add support for reading and embedding css resources referred-to by URLs.
  
  For example, the following is now supported for loading a Google Font:
  
  ```css
  /* The following imports the Monoton font, with _just_ the letter N */
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Monoton&display=swap&text=N');
  ```
  
  What is interesting about this is that the above url points to a css file, which _also_ contains a URL `@import` to the actual font file. Nostalgie will import both of these, treating the font file as a base64-encoded uri. The resulting CSS file will be a stand-alone asset that no longer needs to download the font at runtime, avoiding any risk of flash of unstyled text (FOUT).
  
  Of course, the trade-off here is that this increases the initial render size so it remains to be seen how this plays out.

## [0.73.0] - 2021-02-12
### Changed
- Migrated from `@mdx-js/mdx` to `xdm` for a smaller, faster MDX runtime.

## [0.72.1] - 2021-02-11
### Fixed
- Fixed calculation of `peerDependencies` range for `react` and `react-dom` to correctly use the hard-coded ranges.

## [0.72.0] - 2021-02-11
### Changed
- Synced dependencies.

### Fixed
- Reintegrated `@twind/shim/server` now that it performs non-destructive edits to the markup apart from the `class` attribute values. Bonus: the markup parsing and augmentation is 50% faster.
- Forced `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react-dom` and `@types/react-dom-server` into `peerDependencies` using a range compatible with `>= 16.8.0` or `>= 17.0.0`. It remains to be seen if putting the types in peer dependencies is beneficial or a point of friction.

## [0.71.0] - 2021-02-11
### Added
- Added support for picking among first-party `create-nostalgie-app` templates. With this release, we include `javascript` and `typescript`.
- Added a simple (but fun) Server Function to the default templates. This function demonstrates using the `useQueryFunction` hook with a Server Function. The hook is configured to keep the initial, server-rendered value for 5s and then cycle every 5s.

### Changed
- Changed default `create-nostalgie-app` to use the JavaScript template.

### Fixed
- Reverted treating all files as externals for server functions (for now) because that seemed to break the entrypoint resolution.
- Stopped using the serialized output from `@twind/shim/server`'s `shim()` function because this was causing browser hydration warnings due to minor changes in whitespace.

## [0.70.0] - 2021-02-11
### Changed
- Change `robots.text` from `Disallow: /` to allowing everything but `/.nostalgie` endpoints. This is a temporary measure to allow Nostalgie sites to be crawled.
  
  A likely future direction is to put this file totally in the hands of users via some `./public` directory feature. The `./public` directory approach seems to be the idiomatic solution in the wild. However, it's unclear if that's the _best_ solution. Nostalgie will already copy and include assets referenced by JavaScript code in builds.

## [0.69.4] - 2021-02-10
### Fixed
- Removed debug logs accidentally shipped in `0.69.3`.

## [0.69.3] - 2021-02-10
### Fixed
- Fixed the orchestration of the different build steps so that the node server will not attempt to start until the SSR library is ready.
  
  Also wired up the internal build throttling mechanism that was present but unused.

## [0.69.2] - 2021-02-08
### Changed
- Bumped dependencies:
  
  - `joi@17.4.0`
  - `react-query@3.8.2`

### Fixed
- Fixed obvious (in retrospect) XSS vector in using `JSON.stringify` to encode initial boostrap data into the initial html markup. This is corrected by using [`jsesc`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jsesc) to safely encode data for embedding in a script tag.

## [0.69.1] - 2021-02-06
### Changed
- Bumped dependencies:
  
  - `react-query` to `3.8.0`.
  - `blob-polyfill` to `5.0.20210201`

## [0.69.0] - 2021-02-06
### Added
- Added `create-nostalgie-app`, the easiest way to scaffold out a new Nostalgie project.
  
  With a simple `npx create-nostalgie-app my-app` you have a fully-functioning Nostalgie app in less than 30 seconds.

### Changed
- Increased logging during build and forced clean exit upon completion.
  
  There is some, as-yet-unknown handle keeping Node's event loop alive. To work around that, we're forcing exit via `process.exit(0)` when the build completes.
- Switch to requirin `npm@7` during development to prepare for using workspaces.

## [0.68.5] - 2021-02-05
### Fixed
- Run `npm publish` correctly in `./dist`.

## [0.68.4] - 2021-02-05
### Added
- Added detailed [Contribution guidelines](./docs/Contributing.md) to help newcomers get acquainted with Nostalgie's architecture and codebase.
- Publish releases of Nostalgie automatically, triggered by GitHub releases.

### Changed
- Renamed `nostalgie/internal/server` to `nostalgie/internal/renderer` to better reflect purpose.

## [0.68.3] - 2021-02-04
### Added
- Add `"pakage.json"` as an explicit export in the package's export map. This makes it easier for tooling authors to identify the root of the locally-installed version of `nostalgie` and to figure out the modules' dependencies and version.
- Bumped dependencies to latest within semver range.

## [0.68.2] - 2021-02-02
### Fixed
- Moved required typedef dependencies to the `"dependencies"` field and added `"peerDependencies"` for `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`.

## [0.68.1] - 2021-02-02
### Fixed
- Re-added `devDependencies` for packages like `@mdx-js/react` whose types are dependended upon by nostalgie packages / compiled types.

## [0.68.0] - 2021-02-01
### Added
- Introduce `nostalgie/styling` as a module through-which to deliver a styled-components-like experience. Right now, this is built on `twind` and `twind/css`. (#12)
  
  This PR introduces support for (typed) styling of intrinsic HTML elements _a la_ `styled-components` with both the factory and explicit apis, respectively:
  
  ```ts
  import { styled } from 'nostalgie/styling';
  
  const Button = styled.button`
    border: 1px solid rebeccapurple;
  `;
  ```
  
  ```ts
  import { styled } from 'nostalgie/styling';
  
  const Button = styled('button')`
    border: 1px solid rebeccapurple;
  `;
  ```
  
  Additionally, object syntaxes are supported, like:
  
  ```ts
  import { styled } from 'nostalgie/styling';
  
  const Button = styled({
    border: '1px solid rebeccapurple',
  });
  ```
- React JSX files no longer need to `import * as React from 'react'` as this will be injected automatically. Importing react in this way will have no harmful side-effects and may be considered optional. (#12)

### Changed
- **[BREAKING]** The automatic tailwindcss styling will only be enabled when a `tailwind.config.js` file is found in the root of the project. (#12)

## [0.67.3] - 2021-01-28
### Changed
- Bump `twind` from `0.12` to `0.14` and adjust internals accordingly.

### Fixed
- Removed unused dependencies and build slimmer dist.

## [0.67.2] - 2021-01-28
### Fixed
- Copy the `./src/themes/OneDark.json` theme file into the `./dist/themes/` folder at build time so that it is readable by the mdx compilation worker at build-time.

## [0.67.1] - 2021-01-28
### Fixed
- Mark `@mdx-js/react` and `workerpool` modules as install-time dependencies because we rely on being able to `require.resolve()` their files at build-time.

## [0.67.0] - 2021-01-28
### Added
- Improved the internal wiring of the build pipeline so that no unnecessary work is performed and so that work will be running at maximum concurrency. (#10)
- Add support for automatic browser reloads in `nostalgie dev`. This isn't 'hot reloading' (yet) but nevertheless provides a huge boost to developer ergonomics. (#10)
  
  To opt out:
  
  ```bash
  nostalgie dev --disable-hot-reload
  ```
- Introduce the `--log-level` flag for `nostalgie dev` and `nostalgie build`. (#10)

### Changed
- When authentication is configured, the cookies used to persiste ephemeral and long-lived session state will now always be `Secure` in production.
  
  More precisely, whenever `process.env.NODE_ENV` is not `"development"`, cookies will always be set with the `Secure` flag.

## [0.66.0] - 2021-01-27
### Added
- Added authentication support to nostalgie via the `nostalgie/auth` sub-package. (#7)
  
  Nostalgie authentication currently provides for:
  
  1. Authentication via OpenID-compliant providers via the code flow.
  2. Both `/.nostalgie/login?return_to` and `/.nostalgie/logout?return_to` endpoints for logging in and logging out, respectively.
  3. Authentication state is exposed to server functions in the first, `ctx` argument via the `.auth` property. High-level authentication status can be checked via `ctx.auth.isAuthenticated` and when the user is authenticated, their authentication details can be found on `ctx.auth.credentials.user`, `ctx.auth.credentials.scope` and `ctx.auth.credentials.claims`.
  4. Authentication state is exposed to the front-end application via the `useAuth()` hook exported from `nostalgie/auth`. This hook returns the same form of authentication state as `ctx.auth` in server functions. It can be used, for example, to render a user avatar or make decisions about which routes are available to users.
  
  To configure authentication, the following environment variables must either all be set or none must be set (in which case the auth module is disabled):
  
  `AUTH_ISSUER` - The OpenID issuer url, such as https://nostalgie.us.auth0.com. This URL will be used for automatic OpenID Connect discovery for further authentication configuration.
  `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` - The OpenID client identifier for the application ('client') configured for your Nostalgie app.
  `AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - The OpenID client secret for the application ('client') configured for your Nostalgie app. This is important to keep well protected. It will never be exposed to the front-end.
  `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` - The secret used to encrypt session state in an [Iron](https://npm.im/@hapi/iron)-encoded token.
- Added support for importing `.css` files from JavaScript files. (#8)
  
  Previously the return value of such imports was the url at which the generated CSS file could be found. The ergonomics of this were sub par; it wasn't possible to get Nostalgie to include these files in the initial page render so either there was a FOUC or a slower experience.
  
  The community appears to have settled on the convention that importing a `.css` file should have the _side-effect_ of causing that css to be injected into the DOM. Nostalgie picks up on this convention and will inject the CSS at runtime for lazy-loaded chunks and will inject the CSS during SSR for chunks referenced in routes activated by the current path.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```js
  // Cause the styles in 'style.css' to be loaded into the DOM at the earlier of:
  //   1. SSR page generation when the importing file is referenced in the initial route.
  //   2. Immediately once a lazy chunk is loaded via `.lazy()`.
  import from './style.css';
  ```
